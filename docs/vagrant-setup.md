To get started with using the provided Vagrant configuration and setting up Visual Studio Code for remote development via SSH into the Vagrant box, you can follow these steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you set up your environment, including installing prerequisites, configuring Vagrant, and setting up VS Code.

### Prerequisites
1. **Install VirtualBox**: Download and install VirtualBox from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) which will be used as the VM provider.
2. **Install Vagrant**: Download and install Vagrant from [Vagrant Downloads](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) which is used to manage the development environments.
3. **Install Visual Studio Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
4. **VS Code Remote - SSH Extension**: Install the "Remote - SSH" extension from the VS Code marketplace. This extension allows you to use any remote machine with an SSH server as your development environment.

### Vagrant Setup
1. **Create a Vagrantfile**: Use the Vagrantfile provided in your question, which is already configured with CentOS 8, network settings, provisioning scripts for dependencies, and shared folders.

2. **Initialize Vagrant**:
   - Open a terminal/command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your Vagrantfile is located.
   - Run `vagrant up`. This command will start and provision the virtual machine according to the configurations specified in the Vagrantfile.

3. **SSH into the Vagrant Box**:
   - After the setup completes, you can connect to your Vagrant box by running `vagrant ssh` from the same directory where your Vagrantfile is located.

### Configure Remote SSH in VS Code
1. **SSH Configuration**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the command palette.
   - Type "Remote-SSH: Open Configuration File" and select it.
   - Choose the SSH configuration file to edit (typically found at `~/.ssh/config` on Unix systems).
   - Add the following configuration to connect to your Vagrant machine:
     ```
     Host vagrant-centos
         HostName 192.168.33.10
         User vagrant
         Port 22
         IdentityFile <path-to-your-vagrant-directory>/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
     ```
     Replace `<path-to-your-vagrant-directory>` with the actual path where your Vagrantfile is stored.
     You can find this configuration with command `vagrant shh-config`

2. **Connect to the Vagrant Box Using VS Code**:
   - Open the command palette again (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
   - Type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..." and select it.
   - Choose "vagrant-centos" from the list of configured hosts.
   - VS Code will now attempt to connect to the Vagrant box. Once connected, it will open a new VS Code window configured to use the Vagrant box as the development environment.

### Finalize Setup
- Once connected, you can open the terminal within VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`) and you will be directly interfacing with your Vagrant box. You can run your builds, commits, and watch your code execute in the remote environment.
- Any changes you make in VS Code will be reflected in the Vagrant box, and vice versa, due to the synced folders set up in the Vagrantfile.
